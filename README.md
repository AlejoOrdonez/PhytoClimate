# PhytoClimate
Code measuring the Velocity PhytoClimate change over the las 21ka yers and the next 100yrs.

In doing this, I will be exploring how we can translate the novelty metrics in [Ordonez et al (2016) Nat Clim Change](https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate3127) into Conradi et al. (in review) work on Phyto-climates that builds on his work on [Operationalizing the definition of the biome for global change research](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16580).
